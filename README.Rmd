Try the `Browse to remote file` addin while highlighting text in a file.

## Installation

You can install the browse with:

```r
devtools::install_github("tmastny/browse")
```

## Examples

You can also use 

```r
browse::browse()
```

in the console.

Outside of RStudio, you can also use the relative file path
to open the file on Github:

```r
browse("R/browse.R#L6-L9")
browse("R/browse.R#L6")
browse("R/browse.R")
```

Or you can quickly get the link to share with others:

```{r}
browse::link("R/browse.R")
```
