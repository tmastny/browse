# browse

<!-- badges: start -->

browse makes it easy to open files in Github from RStudio. 
Try the `Browse to remote file` addin while highlighting text in a file.

Alternatively, use `Link to remote file` to automatically copy the url to your clipboard.
This makes it easy to share links in Slack, Github, and Twitter!

## Installation

You can install browse with:

```r
devtools::install_github("tmastny/browse")
```

`browse` now supports Bitbucket and Gitlab.

## Examples

You can also use

```r
browse::browse()
browse::link()
```

in the RStudio console.

Outside of RStudio, you can use the relative file path
to open the remote file:

```r
browse("R/browse.R#L6-L9")
browse("R/browse.R#L6")
browse("R/browse.R")
```
